# Face-Detection-and-Recognition

# Face Recognition
Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

# Face Detection
Recognize, identify and classify faces within images using CNN and image recognition algorithms. In this hands-on project, the goal is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

Skills used: Computer Vision, Keras, CNN, Siamese Networks, Triplet loss, Transfer Learning, Object detection
